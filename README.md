bitcoin mining computers are located where electricity rates vary in real time based on supply and demand of electricity.  Our app will do a calculation to determine if it’s more economic to run the bitcoin mining computers or turn them off.  

One specific application of the idea is to collocate the bitcoin computers with large wind or solar plants that sell electricity to the grid at wholesale rates.  In this case, our app would determine if it’s more economic to sell electricity to the grid or use it internally to mine bitcoin

Background:
Currently, many wind plants in the US sell their electricity to the grid at wholesale rates.  The wholesale prices fluctuates in real-time based on supply and demand.  Sometimes the supply is much greater than the demand and the wholesale electricity rates go negative.  This happens in Germany, CA, and will become a bigger trend as more wind and solar are added to the grid.  

Generally, utility-scale power solar plants have one meter, owned by the utility, that measure the electricity being generated into the utility grid.  The solar plant operator can decide to send the solar electricity to the grid or use it internally “behind the meter.”   

If the bitcoin computers were not collocated with a whole energy generator, they would have to buy electricity from the utility grid at the utility’s retail rate.  In general,  CA retail rates do not fluctuate like wholesale rates so the mining operation would not be able to be able to capture the advantage of low prices from oversupply of generation. Therefore, the bitcoin mining computers have to be collocated with the power plant.  However, rate structures vary from utility to utility.   In TX, for example, the electricity market is deregulated and retail customers may have rates that vary in real time similar to wholesale rates.

Equation that determines if it’s more economic to run the computers or run them off:
[electricity price] * [probability of generating a bitcoin per computation] * [ kWh / computation]
